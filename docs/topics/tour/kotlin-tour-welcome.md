[//]: # (title: Welcome to our tour of Kotlin!)

This tour covers the fundamentals of the Kotlin programming language and can be completed entirely within your 
browser. There is no installation required.

Each chapter in our tutorial contains a practice section, containing exercises that test your understanding of what
you have just learned. We recommend that you complete these exercises in [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org).
Example solutions are provided for each exercise.
